  "review": "Reading this book felt like the author pulling the curtain back on what has really been going on in the United States for the last 400 years. I decide to read this book because I was intersted in learning about the Indian caste system, but instead I am glad to have walked away with an excellent framework for understanding race relations in America and a more comprehenive appreciation for how disenfranchised African Americans have been and continue to be.",
