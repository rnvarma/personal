  "review": "I really enjoyed this book! It was a very candid retelling of Tony’s life. It also is an excellent case study on how Zappos cultivates and defines a culture.\n\nI was inspired by his dedication and passion for others while he built his businesses. I’m excited to take a same approach in my work now and hopefully instill some of the same principles in our business as it grows.\n\nWe tried to define a company culture a year ago, but it really didn’t stick. I think this book provides a great blueprint for how to think about culture. Rather than defining it and then trying to live up to it, it should be descriptive of what the company currently as and what it aspires to be.\n\nOur team is now large enough that I think we’ll have some opportunities to be more intentional with our culture. I think when we were just 3-4 of us, it’s hard to feel the larger sense of group identity. Working remotely due to COVID further complicates that.\n\nI also really resonate with the ideas he brings up around how your culture is not just within your company, but also about how you interact with the external stakeholders: customers, partners, investors. As a startup we have to go above and beyond for our customers and partners just to stay alive and so we are doing a great job right now. However, this book is a good reminder to maintain that above-and-beyond principle even as we grow.  ",
