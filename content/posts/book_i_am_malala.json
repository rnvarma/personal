  "review": "This book was both inspiring and incredibly tragic to read. I cried so much reading it. Sometimes from inspiration and sometimes from sadness.\n\nI can't imagine what it was like for her and her family to return to their town after the army and Taliban fought. To live in and go to school in buildings with bullet holes where a war took place. To go to school everyday with the threat of the Taliban looming large.\n\nMalala and her family are so selfless and show so much generosity and support for the people around them. How can I do the same? Her family would feed children trying to go to school on empty stomachs and help anyone around in their town. In the US there are so many homeless people on the streets that I walk by but often don't do anything to help. I'd like to change that.\n\nI believe I should put more energy into supporting organizations that I believe in, especially those doing work internationally in countries that could benefit the most from the money and support. It costed Malala's father less than my monthly salary to keep his school running for hundreds of students. I'm going to start by donating to the Malala Fung because education for every child is a mission that resonates closely with me.",
