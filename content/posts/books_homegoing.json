  "review": "\"We believe the one who has power. He is the one who gets to write the story. So when you study history, you must ask yourself, Whose story am I missing? Whose voice was suppressed so that this voice could come forth? Once you have figured that out, you must find that story too. From there you get a clearer, yet still imperfect, picture.\"\n\nThis is a book that I will remember for a long while.\n\nIt is the first time, despite all the education I have, that I am starting to understand, at a more fundamental level, the historical context for being an African American.\n\nThe book beautifully builds up to the ending, and then ends very quickly. After finishing the book and closing it, I just sat there and cried. I felt the immense history that both lineages went through to get to that moment. How unlikely their love is, and how different their paths were.",
