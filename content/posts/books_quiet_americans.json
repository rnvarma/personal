  "title": "The Quiet Americans: Four CIA Spies at the Dawn of the Cold War",
  "author": "Scott Anderson",
  "review": "This book was an excellent view into the World War 2 and Cold War era of American history from the unique lens of US intelligence operations. It pulls back the curtain on a lot of details and anecdotes about how the CIA came to exist and operate in the ways we know today.\n\nIn high school policy debate, “securitization” was a popular argument made when critiquing US foreign policy. The idea is that when a great power takes steps to avoid a threat, it leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy which then results in the manifestation of the threat. For example, we deploy troops to the Middle East to root out terrorism, but in the process we kill innocent civilians and further embolden the terrorist groups we were trying to stop. This book fully exposed the harm that US securitization has had, and continues to have, on the world.\n\nWhile I am proud to be an American, there is a lot of shame in our past that often goes undiscussed. Slavery and white supremacy is, to a much larger degree, the prime example. As we start to come to terms with America’s racial roots, I think that we should also take a look at our colonial and imperialistic tendencies. Slavery was our country's original sin, but American imperialism might be our greatest hypocrisy.",
