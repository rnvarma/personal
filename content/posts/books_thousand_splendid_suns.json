  "review": "This book was devastatingly sad. It was also extremely effective at conveying what life was like for women in Afghanistan in the last 40 years. It is particularly timely to read given that the Taliban just retook control of the country and things are apparently worse (hard to imagine) than what was portrayed in the book.\n\nI was surprised by the “happy” ending. It wasn’t necessarily all rainbows and ponies, but Laila lived and ended up with Tariq. I was expecting something terrible to happen to them all the way until the last sentence in the book. And who’s to say that weeks or months after the events in the book, something terrible doesn’t just happen to them then.\n\nThe author does a beautiful job of showing rather than telling. He often doesn’t say what happened, but will just jump into the aftermath of something and describe the mood or reactions from the characters. It really makes you feel the weight of the events and also dread to learn if the worst you had feared did actually transpire.",
