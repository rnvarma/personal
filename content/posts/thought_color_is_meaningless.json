  "content": "Africans aren’t black. In Africa, Africans think of themselves as whatever country they are from. People black when they move to America. Should we stop using the color of someone’s skin to refer to them to stop propagating this flawed form of division?\n\nI refer to myself as brown and often refer to white people as white. But before white people came to America, they were Italian or French or Spanish or Russian. Brown people were Indian or Iraqi or Mexican. When we come to America we are assigned a color so that society, and eventually ourselves, can understand how to treat us and where in line we stand.\n\nShould we instead call people who have black skin African American? Maybe I should stop saying I’m brown and instead refer to myself as Indian or Indian America.\n\nI’ve always said I feel more American than I do Indian. It’s sad, then, that to “feel American” is to know my color and refer to myself by it.",
