  "content": "I don't think that Kamala Harris being elected vice president would have such a large emotional impact on me, but it did. Watching her walk as the Vice President and act as the Vice President is enough to make me teary eyed.\n\nI realized my emotional reaction is because of how unrealistic I believed a story like hers to be. For an Indian, an African America, a women to be elected to the second highest office in the country. It is both comforting and amazing to know that the Vice President has experienced Indian culture and understands what it is like to be a brown person in this country.\n\nI have so many strong and inspiring women in my life. I grew up with my mom and my grandmother and then continued to be inspired by incredible friends I made in high school, ccollege, and work. I am so happy to see that for them, it feels like the ceiling has lifted and they can continue to fulfill their full potential to be the incredible people that they are.",
